# ðŸ¦– Char-RNN Dinosaur Name Generator

A character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained from scratch using NumPy to generate dinosaur names - inspired by real dinosaur names, but uniquely AI-generated.

> Built from the ground up with zero deep learning frameworks - just pure NumPy and passion for sequence modeling!

---

## Project Highlights

- Implemented a full RNN forward and backward pass manually
- Character-level training on a dataset of dinosaur names
- Temperature-controlled sampling for creative diversity
- Generates realistic dinosaur-like names (and sometimes hilarious ones)

## How It Works

- Each dinosaur name is broken into character sequences.
- The RNN learns the probability distribution of the next character given the previous ones.
- After training, you can sample new names starting from any letter.
- Sampling uses temperature to adjust creativity:
  - Low temperature -> more conservative, common names
  - High temperature -> wild, unique, fun names

## Try It Yourself

```python
indices = sample(parameters, char_to_ix, length=30, temperature=0.8, start_char='p')
print(get_dino_name_from_indices(indices, ix_to_char))
```
